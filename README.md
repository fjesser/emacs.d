Emacs configuration in my ~/.emacs.d folder.


In the following, the configuration files are explained in more detail providing an overview of the contents and configured packages. Additionally, other files that are used in this Emacs configuration are explained.

# Init Files

I subdivided my init into the 3 files:

1. `init.el`
   - General configurations for emacs and packages
2. `init-org.el`
   - sourced by `init.el`
   - Org-mode configurations
3. `init-org-addtions.el`
   - sourced by `init.el`
   - Configurations for packages that built upon Org-mode (e.g., org-roam)
